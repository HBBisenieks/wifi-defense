========Switches=======
Considerations:
*Number of ports
*Number of gigbit ports
*PoE capabilities
*Uplink ports--backbone/trunk lines
*Management (a time consideration for maintenance/upgrades)

Players need to make good investments in their network backbone
in order to continue to stay ahead of the game in later levels.
======================

=====Access Points====
Considerations:
*Radio bands
*Management
*MIMO
*Power needs
*Range/signal strength
*Max number of clients

Placement and movement of access points to cover needed zones
one of the main mechanics.  Walls, plumbing, wiring, and lights
are all sources of interference.
